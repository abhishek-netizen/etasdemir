      "Currently, I am a Software Developer at Basarsoft. I graduated with a BSc in Computer Science from Hacettepe University. I wrote my first line of code before I started college in 2017. I have been working professionally since the first day of 2021. I mostly developed native Android (Kotlin, Java) and cross-platform mobile applications (React Native). I enjoy learning recently released technologies and trying them out on small projects, especially if they are in alpha or beta releases. I take joy in solving new problems that come with new technology. When I'm not working, I often read programming articles or newsletters and work on my side projects created to test the latest technologies."
